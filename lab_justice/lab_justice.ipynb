    "We plan on continuing to explore simulation in Python this week, however, this time, we are going to simulate some real-world events that have actually happened in the past.  The goal is for you to see how we can use data science to think about issues of equity and social justice.  As usual, in addition to coding, we want you to get practice having discussions about the data science you are doing and think about how data science can be a useful tool that can help you in your future job and as a citizen.\n",

    "# Puzzle 1: Jury Selection + Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides the right to an ‚Äúimpartial jury‚Äù in criminal prosecutions, but what exactly does this mean? The Supreme Court has said that juries must be drawn from a representative cross-section of the community. In other words, juries should be randomly selected from the eligible population. However, there are many instances in history where it doesn‚Äôt seem like this was the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for example, the case of Berghuis v. Smith.  In 1993, Smith (a black man) was convicted of second-degree murder by an all-white jury and sentenced to life in prison. The jury was selected from a panel of about 100 randomly selected people. Only 3 of them were Black and none of those three made it into the final 37 considered for Smith‚Äôs trial. The county population was approximately 8 percent Black at the time of the trial.  Remember, jury panels are supposed to be selected at random from the eligible population.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Puzzle 1.1: Your Initial Thoughts\n",
    "‚ùì **Group Discussion Question** ‚ùì Because 8% of the eligible population was Black, 3 black people on a panel of 100 might seem low.  Does this difference (8% vs. 3%) seem big to you? Do you think this could be due to chance?\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùì **Individual Reflection Question** ‚ùì  Write a few sentences summarizing what your group members said during your discussion.  Did people think this difference could have been due to chance or not?"

Some people claimed that the overall percentage disparity (between 8% and 3%) was small and reflected no attempt to include or exclude a specified number of black people from the jury.\" They claimed this \"small\" difference could simply be due to chance.  Critics and Smith claimed that the system of jury selection caused the lack of fair and reasonable representation of black people on the jury.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Puzzle 1.2: Writing a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs do a simulation in Python to understand what‚Äôs going on.  Write a simulation to show the expected distribution.  Remember, from the case: we are trying to see if the difference between 8% and 3% is small and reflects no attempt to include or exclude a specified number of African Americans.\"  In other words, **we want to write a function to randomly sample 100 people from a population that has 8% Black people.**  The function should return the number of Black people in each jury.  We can do this multiple times and see how rare it is to get 3 or fewer people in the jury."

    "\n",
    "This next simulation comes from a study looking at female names.  You can read the fully study here if you‚Äôd like: [https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w9873/w9873.pdf](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w9873/w9873.pdf) \n",

    "Here‚Äôs a summary of what happened: Researchers created a standard resume and sent it out to about 500 different ‚ÄúHelp Wanted‚Äù ads in Chicago and Boston.  The resumes that they sent were identical, except they changed the names and email addresses to have either a ‚Äúwhite sounding‚Äù name like Emily or a ‚Äúblack sounding‚Äù name like Lakisha, according to the study.  Assuming that a resume has about a 20% chance of getting a call back and half of the resumes had white sounding names and half had black sounding names, let‚Äôs do this simulation.  We will simulate the results and then look at what actually happened.\n",

    "\n",
    "‚ùì **Group Discussion Question** ‚ùì Before we start coding, let‚Äôs think about this.  When this study was done in real life, the white sounding names had 10.33% callbacks and the black sounding names had 6.87% callbacks.  Some of the companies claimed this difference was due to chance.  Do you think this is a significant difference? Why do you think this happened? Why or why not is this problematic?\n",

Since the content of the resumes are identical, we should expect to get an equal number of call backs for both types of names.  In other words, picking the callbacks should be like random sampling.  Next, we wrote a simulation to randomly sample 20% of 500 resumes 10,000 times.  Half of the 500 resumes are represented as 0s (representing white sounding names) and half of the resumes are represented as 1s (representing black sounding names).   "
