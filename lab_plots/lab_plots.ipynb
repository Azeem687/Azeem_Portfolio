    "You may not know this, but the salaries of the employees at the University of Illinois are publicly available! We have curated this data in a nice, structured dataset called `graybook.csv` for you to explore.  The goal of this lab is to work with real UIUC salary data to explore its properties, answer important questions, and to think about the implications of collecting and analyzing this data.  Throughout the lab, it is important to think about being a critical consumer of data who can not only use statistics and programming to analyze data but can also think about the \"why\" part of data science both in the classroom and in the world, as well how you can use what you learn in class to answer real questions that you have. Let’s get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Work with real UIUC salary data to explore some of the statistics that we talked about in class: mean, median, standard deviation, etc.\n",
    "- Practice creating plots to visualize quantitative data: boxplots and histograms.\n",
    "- See how data science can be used in the real world to think about important social justice issues through individual reflection and discussions with your group.\n",

Ultimately, data through visualizations allow us to tell stories, answer questions, and solve problems. A statistic is good however visual displays of data makes it more powerful.

    "Data can be used to create visualizations which can then be used to create stories, answer questions, and solve problems. Some counter data I would like to collect would be years of experience and education background of professors, associate professors etc. Having this type of data in the data set would add more context as to why an individual makes their salary. Another counter data that would be interesting to collect would be information on how many students a professor teaches. This data would also provide context for their salary and total impact in the university. A potentially really important counter data to collect would be salaries of low wage workers such as janitors and cleaners. It's important to collect this data because the University of Illinois does not just employ professors and teachers but many low wage workers. This low wage salary data would alter potential distributions of the dataset.\n",

    "The general public beenfits from collecting this salary data because they would have a better understanding of how the University pays different professions and on what criteria. The data may harm the university if the data shows that the university is underpaying certain professions. Salary data is public because salartytransparency is an essential step to close the gender pay gap. If salaries were not public, the gender pay gap would be very pronounced but the public would not be able to prove it. Salary transparency could be problematic because people may feel that their salary is confidential for them.\n",
